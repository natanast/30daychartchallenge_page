It’s a creative way to explore data, experiment with visual storytelling, and improve charting skills.\nCheck out the challenge details on the official GitHub page.\nYou can find all the code, data, and individual plots in my GitHub repository.\nFeel free to explore the charts by week and day using the navigation menu above!"

Subsequently, i obtained a M.Sc. in Translational Research in Biomedicine from the Democritus University of Thrace. During my master’s thesis titled ‘Characterization of TP53 gene mutations in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,’ i became interested in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.\nCurrently, my main focus is on analyzing and visualizing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, aiming to extract meaningful biological insights. I am also experienced in creating interactive web applications and websites, making data exploration and visualization more accessible and user-friendly for researchers.\nYou can explore some of my work in my Visual Portfolio."
