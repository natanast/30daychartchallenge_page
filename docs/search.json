Subsequently, i obtained a M.Sc. in Translational Research in Biomedicine from the Democritus University of Thrace. During my master’s thesis titled ‘Characterization of TP53 gene mutations in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,’ i became interested in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.\nCurrently, my main focus is on analyzing and visualizing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, aiming to extract meaningful biological insights. I am also experienced in creating interactive web applications and websites, making data exploration and visualization more accessible and user-friendly for researchers.\nYou can explore some of my work in my Visual Portfolio."
