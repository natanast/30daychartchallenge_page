## Welcome

This website showcases my participation in the ***30 Day Chart Challenge***.

The **#30DayChartChallenge** is a data visualization event where participants create and share one chart per day throughout the month of April, each inspired by a specific daily theme and prompt. Itâ€™s a creative way to explore data, experiment with visual storytelling, and improve charting skills.

Check out the challenge details on the official [GitHub](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge/Edition2025) page.

You can find all the code, data, and individual plots in my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/natanast/30DayChartChallenge).

Feel free to explore the charts by week and day using the navigation menu above!
